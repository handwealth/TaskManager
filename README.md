## Features

- Fetch all tasks from the backend API
- Add a new task with title, description, and status
- Update an existing task
- Persist tasks in a JSON file on the backend

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+ recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) if you want to run using Docker

---

### Running Locally (Without Docker)

1. **Start Backend**

-bash
cd backend
npm install
node server.js
The backend server will start at: http://localhost:5000

Start Frontend

In a new terminal window:

cd frontend
npm install
npm start
The frontend React app will start at: http://localhost:3000

---

*Running With Docker Compose*

Build and start both services:
docker compose up --build
Access frontend at http://localhost:3000. The frontend will communicate with backend at http://localhost:5000.

To stop the services:

docker compose down

## ðŸ”„ Caching with LocalStorage

To improve performance, the app uses basic client-side caching:

- On app load, tasks are first loaded from `localStorage` (if available).
- If not cached, tasks are fetched from the backend and cached.
- When tasks are added or deleted, both the app state and the localStorage cache are updated.
- A "ðŸ”„ Refresh" button lets users manually re-fetch the latest tasks from the backend.

### Why?
This improves responsiveness by avoiding unnecessary backend requests on every page load.

### Notes
- Tasks are stored persistently in backend/tasks.json.
- Make sure ports 3000 (frontend) and 5000 (backend) are free before running.
- The frontend caches tasks in localStorage to improve load speed.
